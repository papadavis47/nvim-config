# My Own LazyVim

## As of June 2025

**Neovim is fun :)**

That is the main reason for me to stay with this editor.

I also use Zed, which is an awesome tool. But I am going to stick with some Neovim in my life for the foreseeable future because it is just simply fun.

And I want to keep learning about Vim, too.

_Also, because the process of learning and getting better using Vim is fun :)_

It is a fascinating journey 🤓

I install my version on new machines with:

```shell

cd ~/.config
git clone git@github.com:papadavis47/nvim-config.git nvim

```

Based on the starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started on your own version.

```

```
