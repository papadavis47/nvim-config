# My Own LazyVim

## As of June 2025

**Neovim is fun :)**

That is the main reason for me to stay with this editor.

I also use Zed and Windsurf - both of which are wonderful tools, also. But I am going to stick with some Neovim in my life for the foreseeable future because it is just simply fun.

And I want to keep learning about Vim, too. *Also, because the process of learning is fun :)

It is a fun journey.

Based on the starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started on your own version.
